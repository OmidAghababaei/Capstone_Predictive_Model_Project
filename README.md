In this  Project,  we create a product to highlight the prediction algorithm that you have built and to provide an interface that can be accessed by others. Accordingly, we build  

- **A Shiny application** that takes as input a phrase (multiple words) in a text box input and outputs a prediction of the next word.

- The link for the Shiny Application is [Here](https://aghababaei-omid.shinyapps.io/Final-Project/)
